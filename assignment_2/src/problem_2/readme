To run decision tree algorithm:

1. source /scratch/cs434spring2018/env_3.5/bin/activate.csh
2. python3 ./decision_tree.py

This will run using 6 different depth levels (1-6)
success rate is saved in "train_rates.csv" and "test_rates.csv"

You can then type "make" which will output "stump.png" which shows a representation of the
last training run (depth of 6)
